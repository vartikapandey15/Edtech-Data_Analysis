# Edtech-Data_Analysis

Assume you are a Data Analyst in an EdTech company. Your company is focused on
accelerating its growth by increasing the number of enrolled users.
Therefore, you have been asked to analyse various aspects of customer acquisition to see the
status of new usersâ€™ growth in your company. The insights you discover will help your business
team in designing a better marketing strategy for your company.
Expected Outcome
1. Brainstorm and identify the right metrics and frame proper questions for analysis. Your
analysis should help your :
a. Business team to understand the lead's journey and stages with scope for improvement
b. Business heads to understand their team performance
c. Managers to understand their target areas
2. In case you identify any outliers in the data set, make a note of them and exclude them from
your analysis.
3. Build the best suitable dashboard presenting your insights.

Using both Tableau and Jupyter Notebook in combination can be a powerful approach for data analysis, as Tableau provides interactive data visualization capabilities while Jupyter Notebook allows for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Here's a general data analysis process using these tools:

1. **Define the Problem and Goals**: Clearly outline the problem you want to solve and the specific goals of your analysis. This will help guide your data exploration and visualization efforts.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather the relevant data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, or APIs. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. You can use Python libraries like Pandas in Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and transformation tasks.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization with Tableau**: Load the cleaned data into Tableau for initial exploration. Tableau's drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to create interactive visualizations and gain insights from your data. Use different chart types, filters, and calculated fields to explore patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.

4. **Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook**: After gaining a basic understanding of the data with Tableau, export the preprocessed data from Tableau into a format compatible with Jupyter Notebook (e.g., CSV, Excel). Import the data into a Jupyter Notebook and use Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform more in-depth analysis. This might include statistical tests, data aggregation, and advanced visualizations.

5. **Feature Engineering (Optional)**: Depending on your goals, you may need to engineer new features or perform data transformations in Jupyter Notebook to enhance the predictive power of your data.

6. **Machine Learning (Optional)**: If your analysis requires predictive modeling, you can utilize machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn in Jupyter Notebook. Split your data into training and testing sets, select appropriate algorithms, train the models, and evaluate their performance using various metrics.

7. **Integrate Insights**: Based on your findings from both Tableau and Jupyter Notebook, summarize your insights and observations. Visualizations created in Tableau can be embedded in your Jupyter Notebook to present a cohesive and interactive analysis.

8. **Generate Reports/Dashboards**: Create comprehensive reports or interactive dashboards using Tableau to share your findings with stakeholders or team members. Tableau's visualizations can be dynamic, allowing users to interact with the data on their own.

9. **Iterate and Refine**: Data analysis is often an iterative process. Review your analysis, gather feedback, and make improvements as needed.

By combining the strengths of Tableau for visualization and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling, you can create a robust and insightful data analysis pipeline.
